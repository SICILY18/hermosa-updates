# 🔧 Fix Vite Manifest Error on Hostinger

## 🎯 **Problem Solved!**
The Vite manifest error occurs because Laravel expects assets in `/public/build/` but they're in `/build/` after moving public folder contents to root.

## 📤 **Steps to Fix on Hostinger:**

### **Step 1: Upload New Build Folder**
1. **Delete the old `build` folder** from your Hostinger public_html
2. **Upload the new `public/build` folder** from your local machine
3. **Your structure should be:**
```
public_html/
├── public/
│   └── build/          ← Laravel looks here
│       ├── manifest.json
│       └── assets/
├── index.php
├── .env
└── ... other files
```

### **Step 2: Alternative Quick Fix**
If you prefer to keep build in root, create this structure:
```
public_html/
├── build/              ← Your current assets
├── public/
│   └── build/          ← Copy/symlink here
│       ├── manifest.json
│       └── assets/
```

## 🚀 **What We Fixed:**

✅ **Updated `vite.config.js`** - Now builds to `public/build/` directory  
✅ **Rebuilt assets** - New manifest and assets generated  
✅ **PostgreSQL issue resolved** - Database connection working
